Playing Aquaria on OpenBSD.


Aquaria ([GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/aquaria), [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/24420/Aquaria/)) is an action-adventure game set in a massive underwater world teeming with life and filled with ancient secrets.

I use the branch [controllerfixup](https://github.com/AquariaOSE/Aquaria/tree/controllerfixup) from the [Aquaria repository](https://github.com/AquariaOSE/Aquaria).


**Warning:** Please don't use the diffs on games/aquaria and graphics/glpng from this repository. These are for [thfr](https://github.com/rfhtv) [CVS repository](https://thfr.info/cgi-bin/cvsweb/mystuff/games/aquaria/) and [OpenBSD Ports](http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/graphics/glpng/) respectively.

I need to build this update for [glpng](https://github.com/reivyr/openbsd-aquaria/tree/master/graphics/glpng) first, otherwise it doesn't get recognized by the aquaria port.


For more information about playing this please read the [README](https://github.com/reivyr/openbsd-aquaria/blob/master/games/aquaria/pkg/README) file from this repository.
