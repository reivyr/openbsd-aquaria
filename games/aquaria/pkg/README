Aquaria
=======

To play Aquaria you need the original game assets purshased from GOG or Steam
or Humble Bundle. After buy it, you can use gogrepo or depotdownloader for
GOG or Steam respectively to download the game to your computer.

After that, you should create a symlink in your game directory:
$ cd /path/to/game
$ ln -s ${PREFIX}/share/${PKGSTEM}/files override

You can start aquaria normally if you are in the game directory, otherwise
you need to setup an env. variable first:
$ export AQUARIA_DATA_PATH=/path/to/game

If you have problems with full screen mode (this is the default mode) you
can disable it by adding <ScreenMode full="0" /> in the <Video> section of
the file $HOME/.Aquaria/preferences/usersettings.xml

Mods
----
If you want to play the default mods you need to do this after you have
$HOME/.Aquaria (created when you play the first time):
$ cp -R ${PREFIX}/share/${PKGSTEM}/game_scripts/_mods/* $HOME/.Aquaria/_mods

You can download other mods from the game menu.
